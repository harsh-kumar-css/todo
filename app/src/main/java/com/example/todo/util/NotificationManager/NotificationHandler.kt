 as when we want to launch some activity of our app from another app, but the other app don't have the permission to do so
 here pending intents come in picture
 pending intents are a wrapper around a regular intent that is designed to be used by another application, that gives
 permission to the other app to perform the action in our application with all the permissions that we have granted
 to our application
